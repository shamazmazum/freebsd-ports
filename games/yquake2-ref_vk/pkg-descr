This is the vkQuake2 vulkan renderer library ported to Yamagi Quake II.

Yamagi Quake II is an enhanced client for id Software's Quake II with
focus on offline and coop gameplay. Both the gameplay and the graphics
are unchanged, but many bugs in the last official release were fixed
and some nice to have features like widescreen support and a modern
OpenGL 3.2 renderer were added. Unlike most other Quake II source
ports Yamagi Quake II is fully 64-bit clean. It works perfectly on
modern processors and operating systems. Yamagi Quake II runs on
nearly all common platforms; including FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD,
OpenBSD, Windows and macOS (experimental).

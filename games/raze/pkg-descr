Raze is a fork of Build engine games backed by GZDoom tech and
combines Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, Redneck Rampage, Shadow Warrior and
Exhumed/Powerslave in a single package. It is also capable of playing
Nam and WW2 GI.

The game modules are based on the following sources:
* Duke Nukem: JFDuke, EDuke 2.0, World Tour extensions from DukeGDX
  and some minor fixes from EDuke32.
* Redneck Rampage: Nuke.YKT's reconstructed source available in the
  Rednukem Git repo.
* Blood: NBlood.
* Shadow Warrior: SWP and VoidSW.
* Exhumed/Powerslave: PCExhumed, with some enhancements inspired by
  PowerslaveGDX.

Padasip is designed to simplify adaptive signal processing tasks
within python (filtering, prediction, reconstruction). For code
optimisation, this library uses numpy for array operations.

Also in this library is presented some new methods for adaptive signal
processing. The library is designed to be used with datasets and also
with real-time measuring (sample-after-sample feeding).

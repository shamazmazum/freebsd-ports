Supaplex is a video game created by Philip Jespersen and Michael
Stopp, two Swiss students, and published by Digital Integration in
1991. It is an extended clone of Boulder Dash.

OpenSupaplex is a 1:1 reimplementation of the original game in C and
SDL, with just a few changes to make it easy to use with game
controllers, and also easy to port to any platform.

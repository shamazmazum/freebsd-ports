Kandria is an opensource game written in Common Lisp. This package
contains its C dependencies.

Explore a ruined open world of caverns and settlements. Hack and slash
your way through missions: patrol, repair, scavenge - choose your
quests and dialogue. Or go fishing, forage mushrooms, and race the
clock! The old world is gone - the future is up to you.

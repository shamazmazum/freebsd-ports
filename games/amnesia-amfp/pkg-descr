Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a survival horror video game developed
by The Chinese Room and published by Frictional Games. Originally
meant to be a mod by The Chinese Room, the game is an indirect sequel
to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, which was both developed and produced by
Frictional Games. While set in the same universe as the previous game,
it features a new cast of characters and time setting.

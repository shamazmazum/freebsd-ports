This port is in pretty bad shape, probably contains infinitely many
bugs and what's the most important, I do not have any idea how to
install the game data files system-wide, so you need to install them
somewhere in your home directory and run the game from that directory,
like so:

$ cp -r /path/to/original/vangers/data ~/vangers
$ cd ~/vangers/data
$ vangers
EOM

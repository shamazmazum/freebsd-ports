To play the game you need to do the following:

* Obtail files from the original game (a Steam version will do).
* Convert all FBX models to Collada format (.dae). You can use
  Autodesk FBX Converter for that.
* Run $find . -name "*.ent" -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i.bak 's\.FBX/\.dae/'
  from the top directory of the game assets.
* Copy game assets to %%DATADIR%%.

Enjoy!
